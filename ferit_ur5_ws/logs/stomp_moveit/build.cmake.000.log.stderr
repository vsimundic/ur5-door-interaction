[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/RVLuser/ferit_ur5_ws/src/ur5_configs/stomp_ros/stomp_moveit/CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstomp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "stomp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "stomp" with any of
  the following names:

    stompConfig.cmake
    stomp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "stomp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "stomp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "stomp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
