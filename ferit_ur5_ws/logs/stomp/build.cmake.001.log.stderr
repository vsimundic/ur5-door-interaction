  By not providing "Findros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate" with any of the following names:

    ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplateConfig.cmake
    ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ros_industrial_cmake_boilerplate" provides a separate development package
  or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
